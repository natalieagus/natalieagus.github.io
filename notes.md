### Basics of Information Theory

  

#### Warm Up

  

Suppose that you are to guess the value of a 16-bit number: 0x$Z_1Z_2Z_3Z_4$ You are told that the value of $Z_1$ is B. Thus you have been given [N] bits of information. What is the value of [N]?

Obviously $Z_x$ represents 4 bits since these are in hexadecimal number system (indicated with the prefix of `0x`.) We are literally told that the first hex digit is $B = 1011$. Hence we are given ****4 bits of information****.  There are still other 12 bits that we do not know of its value.

Of course, it has to be Hello World, right?

$5+2=10$

$\begin{aligned}
5+2=10\end{aligned}$

The Gamma function satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall
n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
