<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<h3 id="the-os-kernel">The OS Kernel</h3>
<p>The OS Kernel is a <em>special</em> program that is written to <em><strong>manage</strong></em> and <strong>oversees</strong> the execution of all other processes in system.</p>
<p>It has the <strong>highest privilege</strong> in computer system, i.e: it can terminate any program, has access to all kinds of hardware resources (Physical Memory, I/O devices).</p>
<p>A few of its important role include <em>memory management</em>, <em>I/O handling</em>, and <em>process scheduling</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many other roles of the OS Kernel that is not discussed here. We will learn more about them next term.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="a-complete-process-context">A Complete Process Context</h3>
<p>In the previous chapter, we learned that each process has its own <em>VA to PA mapping</em> we call as <strong>context</strong>, hence allowing it to run on its own <em>virtual memory</em>.</p>
<p>Assigning a separate context for each process has two crucial benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Allows <strong>timesharing</strong> among processes, hence user can multitask, i.e: switch the execution of multiple programs using a single core.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allows each process to run in <strong>isolation</strong> – therefore every program can be written as if it has <strong>access to all memory</strong>, without considering where other programs reside.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Kernel need to store  more information about a process (<em>and not just its VA to PA mapping</em>), so that it can <em>pause the execution</em> and <em>resume</em> any of them later on without any conflict.</p>
<p>A more complete list of components that make up a process <strong>context</strong> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Values of<code>R0, R1, ... R30</code></li>
<li>VA to PA mapping</li>
<li>PC value</li>
<li>Stack state</li>
<li>Program (and shared code)</li>
<li>Virtual I/O devices (console, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Figure below, we illustrate <code>N</code> processes that are present in the system: <code>P1, P2, ..., P3</code> – each having its own information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These processes are <strong>isolated</strong> from one another, meaning that <code>Pi</code> cannot access (or corrupt) the memory space of other process  <code>Pj</code> because each of them run on a separate virtual memory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Writing an Operating System Kernel is not a trivial task as one has to take into consideration a plethora of <em>issues</em> (security, performance, memory management, scheduling, etc). However with its presence, it makes <em>easier to write all other programs</em>. <strong>It provides a layer of abstraction, allowing each program to run on a  <em>virtual machine</em></strong>, devoid of any knowledge about any other processes.</p>
<h3 id="building-a-virtual-machine">Building a Virtual Machine</h3>
<h4 id="kernel-mode-and-user-mode">Kernel Mode and User Mode</h4>
<p>To support a safe <em>virtual machine</em> for each process, we need to establish the notion of <strong>dual mode system</strong>, that is a system that has a <strong>Kernel Mode</strong> (privileged mode) and a <strong>User Mode</strong> (non-privileged mode):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The OS Kernel runs in <em>full privilege</em> mode called the <strong>Kernel Mode</strong>, and it oversees the execution of all processes in the computer system, handles real I/O devices, and emulate virtual I/O device for each process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All other programs do <strong>not</strong> have such <em>privileged</em> features like the kernel. We call these programs as running in <em>non-priveleged</em> <strong>mode</strong> called the <strong>User Mode</strong> with limited access to any hardware resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>No direct access to actual hardware,</li>
<li>No direct access other process’ address space</li>
<li>No knowledge about other processes’ context and processor state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Kernel will <strong>handle</strong> the need of these programs running in user mode for access to various hardware resources: access to I/O devices, interprocess communication, allocation/deallocation of  shared memory space, etc.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>major benefit</strong>: programs can be easily written as if they have <em>absolute</em> access to <em>all</em> hardware resources (not just the physical memory), without having to worry about sharing them with other running processes.</p>
<h2 id="os-multiplexing-and-context-switching">OS Multiplexing and Context Switching</h2>
<p><strong>Multiplexing</strong> is a method of sharing the resources in a computer <strong>system</strong> for multiple running programs at the same time. The OS kernel handles the multiplexed execution of various running programs in a single CPU – <strong>switching between <em>contexts</em> so rapidly</strong> – so that for the users, the computer is seemingly able to run multiple processes in “<em>parallel</em>”.</p>
<p>The main idea of OS multiplexing is illustrated below using two processes <code>P1</code> and <code>P2</code>, sharing a single system:</p>
<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/p5r7q2uit6vbdkz/process.png?raw=1" alt="“F1”" width="70%" height="70%">
<p>The “<em>arrow</em>” illustrates the timeline of execution:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At first, the CPU runs some task from <code>P1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After some time <code>t</code>, imagine that a <em>timed  interrupt</em> (caused by other asynchronous hardware, e.g: a <em>timer</em>) occurs. This causes the CPU to execute part of the kernel program that handles such <strong>asynchronous interrupt</strong>, hence <em>pausing</em> the execution of <code>P1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This <em>interrupt handler</em> takes control of the CPU when hardware interrupt occurs, and <strong>saves</strong> the  current <strong>states</strong> (PC, Registers, etc)  of P1 to the Memory (<em>so that P1’s progress is not lost and can be resumed later on</em>) before performing a “<em>context switch</em>”:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load the states of <code>P2</code> to the CPU (and also the required resources, mapping, etc), and</li>
<li>Resume the execution of <code>P2</code>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In practice, the <em>interrupt handler</em> will examine the <em>cause</em> of the asynchronous interrupt. In the event of periodic interrupt caused by a timer, the handler will delegate the task to the  <strong>kernel scheduler</strong> whose job is to decide <em>which</em> process to run next, and prepare the necessary information / context to load this process back into the CPU so that the selected process may resume smoothly. When the scheduler returns to the handler, the handler resumes execution of the CPU by simply setting <code>PC</code> <span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mo>←</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\leftarrow</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.36687em; vertical-align: 0em;"></span><span class="mrel">←</span></span></span></span></span> <code>Reg[XP] - 4</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>P2</code> runs and progresses for some time <code>t</code> before another <em>hardware interrupt</em> occurs. The entire context switch process is repeated to pause <code>P2</code>, resume <code>P1</code>, and so forth.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key technology that allows for OS Multiplexing is the <strong>asynchronous hardware interrupt.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will simply call asynchronous interrupt as just “interrupt” for simplicity. A synchronous interrupt is called as “<em>trap</em>” instead (see the later chapters).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="hardware-support-for-os-multiplexing">Hardware Support for OS Multiplexing</h2>
<p>To allow for proper multiplexing, four things must be supported <strong><strong>in the hardware level</strong></strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There has to be a way to <strong>asynchronously interrupt</strong> a currently running program <em>periodically</em> via hardware, since that program is currently using the CPU and will not stop voluntarily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hardware has to know how to <strong>direct</strong> the PC CPU to the right handler program when <strong>interrupt</strong> occurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Two execution modes</strong> in the system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kernel mode</strong>: that allows the CPU to have ultimate access to all hardware and data, so that it can perform crucial process management tasks such as “<em>saving</em>” the states (Register contents, stack, PC, etc) of the interrupted process (to be resumed safely later on).</li>
<li><strong>User mode</strong>: a non-priviledged mode that disallow programs to corrupt illegal memory space of other programs or hijack resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other interrupts must be <strong>disabled</strong> when this process of “saving state” occurs  (otherwise data will be lost).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="beta-asynchronous-interrupt-hardware"><span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>β</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8888799999999999em; vertical-align: -0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right: 0.05278em;">β</span></span></span></span></span> Asynchronous Interrupt Hardware</h3>
<p>Recall the <strong>asynchronous interrupt</strong> datapath as shown in the figure below:</p>
<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hzzbg7lqy626zon/IRQ.png?raw=1" alt="“F1”" width="60%" height="60%">
<p>One of the inputs that is received by the Control Unit is <code>IRQ</code> (1-bit).  In the event of <em>interrupt</em>, the <code>IRQ</code> value will be <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>At each CLK cycle, the Control Unit always checks whether <code>IRQ</code> is <code>1</code> or <code>0</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that <code>IRQ</code> may turn to be <code>1</code> asynchronously, e.g: in the “<em>middle</em>” of a particular CPU CLK cycle.  However the Control Unit is synchronised with CPU CLK. Therefore, this will only <em>trigger</em> an interrupt in the next CPU CLK tick.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If <code>IRQ==0</code>, the Control Unit produces all control signals as dictated by <code>OPCODE</code> received.</li>
<li>Else if <code>IRQ==1</code>, the Control Unit <em>traps</em> the PC onto the interrupt handler located at <code>XAddr</code>, by setting <code>PCSEL</code> value into <code>101</code>; <em>so that the PC points to <code>XAddr</code> in the next clock cycle.</em>
<ul>
<li>At the same time, it stores the address of the <em>next</em> instruction (<code>PC+4</code>) at Register <code>XP</code> (<code>R30</code>).</li>
<li><code>R30</code> is a <strong>special register</strong> is always used to hold the <em>return address</em> in the event of interrupt (or illegal operation) so that the system knows how to resume the interrupted program later on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A kernel scheduler will typically configure some system timer to <em>fire</em> at some interval. This timer runs <strong>asynchronously</strong> with the CPU, and sets the <code>IRQ</code> signal to <code>1</code> each time it <em>fires</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interrupt hardware configuration <strong>forces</strong> the PC CPU to execute the interrupt handler at <code>XAddr</code> in the next cycle each time the timer <em>fires</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The register transfer language that describes what happens in the datapath when <code>IRQ==1</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>If (IRQ==1 &amp;&amp; PC31 == 0):
	Reg[XP] &lt;- PC + 4`
	PC &lt;- Xaddr
</code></pre>
<h3 id="asynchronous-interrupt-handler">Asynchronous Interrupt Handler</h3>
<p>The asynchronous interrupt handler is located at <code>XAddr</code>, which is usually pre-determined memory address. In <span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>β</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8888799999999999em; vertical-align: -0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right: 0.05278em;">β</span></span></span></span></span> CPU, <code>XAddr</code> is set at <code>0x8000 0008</code>.</p>
<p>The first few instructions of the interrupt handler saves current process states (<code>R0</code> to <code>R30</code> contents, PC state, stack, and others) in <strong>process table</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Process table:</strong> a Kernel data structure that stores all the states of running processes in the machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, the handler will figure out which specific <strong>service routine</strong> needs to be called to <em>service</em> the interrupt, e.g: scheduler, or I/O routines.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the service routine returns back to this interrupt handler. The handler finally sets  <code>PC</code> <span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mo>←</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\leftarrow</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.36687em; vertical-align: 0em;"></span><span class="mrel">←</span></span></span></span></span> <code>Reg[XP]-4</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the value of <code>Reg[XP]-4</code>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>It depends.</em> The <strong>service routine</strong> may or may not changethe value of <code>Reg[XP]</code> before returning to the interrupt handler:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the value of    <code>Reg[XP]</code> is unchanged, then the interrupted program resumes.</li>
<li>Else, it means that the CPU executes <em>another</em> program.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In any case, <code>Reg[XP]-4</code>  contains the address of instruction that the CPU should execute when the interrupt handler returns.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="dual-mode-support">Dual Mode Support</h3>
<p>Since the OS Kernel is a program that manages the execution of all other processes in the system, it is <strong>crucial</strong> to <em>restrict</em> access to the Kernel for <strong>safety reasons</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is, to prevent a normal program from <em>jumping</em> to the address in memory that contains Kernel code and “<em>hack</em>” the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <strong>prevention</strong> is done via hardware.</p>
<p>Firstly, we need to establish some notion:</p>
<ul>
<li>We call the  MSB (most significant bit) of the PC register as the <strong>Supervisor Bit</strong>.</li>
<li>Whenever the PC executes any code in an address where its MSB is <code>1</code>, it means that the CPU is running in the <strong>Kernel Mode</strong>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the MSB of the content in PC Register MSB is 0, the CPU is said to be running in the <strong>User Mode</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That means we can divide the physical memory address space into two sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User space</strong>: Addresses which MSB is <code>0</code>: from <code>0x0000 0000</code> to <code>0x0111 1111</code></li>
<li><strong>Kernel space</strong>: Addresses which MSB is <code>1</code>: from <code>0x1000 0000</code> to <code>0x1111 1111</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kernel program and kernel data (privileged information, data structures, etc) are stored in the Kernel space. The rest of the program in the system live in the user space.</p>
<p>With this notion, it is easy to enforce restricted access to the kernel space:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programs runing in user mode (<code>PC31 == 0</code>) can never <em>branch</em> or <em>jump</em> to instructions in the kernel space.
<blockquote>
<p>Computations of next instruction address in<code>BEQ</code>, <code>BNE</code>, and <code>JMP</code> cannot change <code>PC31</code> value from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Programs runing in user mode (<code>PC31 == 0</code>) can never <em>load</em>/<em>store</em> to data from/to the kernel space.
<blockquote>
<p>Computations of addresses in <code>LD</code>, <code>LDR</code> and <code>ST</code> ignores the MSB.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Entry to the kernel mode can only be done via restricted entry points. In <span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>β</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8888799999999999em; vertical-align: -0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right: 0.05278em;">β</span></span></span></span></span>, there are only three entry points:
<ul>
<li>Interrupts (setting PC to <code>Xaddr</code>),</li>
<li>Illegal operations (setting PC to <code>ILLOP: 0x8000 0004</code>), or</li>
<li>Reset (setting PC to <code>RESET: 0x8000 0000</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reentrancy">Reentrancy</h3>
<p>When the CPU is in the kernel mode (<code>PC31 == 1</code>), i.e: handling an interrupt – it is important to consider whether or not we should allow interrupts to occur. Handlers which are interruptible are called <strong>re-entrant</strong>.</p>
<p>In <span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>β</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8888799999999999em; vertical-align: -0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right: 0.05278em;">β</span></span></span></span></span> CPU, handlers are <strong>not re-entrant.</strong> Interrupts are <strong>disabled</strong> when it is in kernel mode:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>IRQ</code> signal is ignored in the hardware when <code>PC31 == 1</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This means that while user programs are interruptible, kernel programs are not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason behind disabling interrupt while being in the Kernel mode is to prevent the Kernel from corrupting itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the scenario where the interrupt handler is in the middle of saving program states. Allowing another interrupt to occur in the middle of a save might cause data corruption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The drawback to an interruptible kernel is that there’s no way to get the system to work again if the kernel is buggy and runs into an infinite loop, except via hard reset. The kernel program has to be written very carefully so as not to contain such bugs.</p>
<h3 id="timer-example">Timer Example</h3>
<p>In this section, we illustrate an example of how a basic Kernel Scheduler works with the support of hardware.</p>
<p>Consider a <span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>β</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8888799999999999em; vertical-align: -0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right: 0.05278em;">β</span></span></span></span></span> computer having a 16-bit counter (<em>hardware</em>) with frequency of 50 Hz that runs <strong>asynchronously</strong> with the CPU. This counter will be used as a timer for process scheduling.</p>
<p>Upon start-up, the Kernel can set the IRQ signal to point to the an arbitrary bit of the counter (assume that the pointer’s output is passed through a rising-edge detector so IRQ is <code>1</code> for 1 CPU clock cycle during a rising edge only).</p>
<p>For example, if it points to the <code>4</code><span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">^{th}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.849108em; vertical-align: 0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class=""></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height: 0.849108em;"><span class="" style="top: -3.063em; margin-right: 0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height: 2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathdefault mtight">t</span><span class="mord mathdefault mtight">h</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> bit:</p>

<li>There’s 0.32 seconds between rising edges.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that the <code>IRQ</code> value will be <code>1</code> <strong>once</strong> every 0.32 seconds.</p>
<p>If at first the CPU is executing instructions of Program <code>P1</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After 0.32 seconds, <code>IRQ</code> turns to <code>1</code>. This triggers an interrupt, and the control signals will cause PC will execute the interrupt handler instruction at <code>XAddr</code> in the next cycle (and saving the <em>supposed</em> <em>next</em> instruction at <code>Reg[XP]</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The handler at <code>XAddr</code> must <em>save register states</em>, branch to the <em>scheduler</em>, and resume the program after the scheduler returns. Note that <code>Reg[XP]</code> may or may not be the same as when <em>before</em> <code>BR(scheduler_handler, LP)</code> is executed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>X_addr : ST(R0, save_location) || save register states at an allocated address
ST(R1, save_location+4)
ST(R2, save_location+8)
ST(R3, save_location+12)
....
ST(R30, save_location+30*4) 

CMOVE(kstack, SP) || use kernel stack
BR(scheduler_handler, LP) || branch to the scheduler

|| return instruction from scheduler
LD(save_location,R0) ||  restore register states
LD(save_location+4,R1)   
...
LD(save_location+30*4, R30)

SUBC(XP, 4, XP) || Reduce XP by 4 to re-execute the instruction that was interrupted by the timer
JMP(XP)  || Resume execution
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Although not written,  <code>save_location</code> is a label, representing an address to store P1’s states.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Observation:  in this simple example, the handler is written such that it <em>always branches to the scheduler</em>. In practice, there are many kinds of hardware interrupts (not just from a timer) that needs to be handled differently depending on its <em>type</em>. We will have a hands-on experience about this in Lab 8, and also in the next term.</p>
<h2 id="trap">Trap</h2>
<p>A trap, is type of <strong>synchronous interrupt</strong> caused by an <em>exceptional</em> condition when the CPU executes an instruction, such as illegal operations, division by zero, invalid memory access, etc.</p>
<p>This results in a switch to kernel mode via trap handler (e.g: <code>PC</code> <span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mo>←</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\leftarrow</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.36687em; vertical-align: 0em;"></span><span class="mrel">←</span></span></span></span></span> <code>ILLOP</code>). The handler will examine the cause of the trap, and perform the appropriate action before (<em>if possible</em>) returning control to the originating process.</p>
<p>Recall how user programs do not have privileged access, which means that they do not have access to the hardwares directly. This is because hardwares <strong><strong>are shared</strong></strong> among programs, and in order to allow \textit{convenience when writing programs} (programs are run in virtual machine and written with complete disregard of the existence of other programs in memory), we trade the freedom of direct access to the hardwares.</p>
<p>~\</p>
<p>~\</p>
<p>This section explains how user programs can communicate with the OS Kernel if they need input from I/O devices or output to I/O devices.</p>
<p>\begin{theorem}</p>
<p>The process of  transferring control of the CPU to Kernel voluntarily is <strong><strong>known as the supervisor call (SVC)</strong></strong> (sometimes it is also called ‘system call’ as well). A user program can invoke the Kernel from its code by executing \textit{a particular <strong><strong>ILLOP</strong></strong> (bad opcode)} and leaving its request at R0.</p>
<p>\end{theorem}</p>
<p>In other words, the user program may purpose cause an exception to occur. In this SVC event, the <strong><strong>hardware</strong></strong> causes the PC to jump to the ILLOP handler and returns control to the kernel (the ILLOP handler itself \textit{is part of the kernel code in the event of illegal operation – bad opcode}.</p>
<p><sub>\</sub>\</p>
<p>The kernel will recognise this particular ILLOP as user-mode supervisor call. The procedure for SVC is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The user program has to provide arguments in R0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ILLOP handler will  look at R0 and invoke the right Kernel program to provide the requested service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Kernel Program that tends to this service  will return the result in R0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ILLOP handler resumes the execution of the user program</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One common scenario where a user program needs to communicate with the Kernel OS is when asking for keyboard / mouse input, or when requesting to print certain output to the screen. For example, the code <code>printf</code> (to print to screen in C) itself is actually a specific ILLOP when translated into assembly. It will trap the program into the ILLOP handler, transferring the control to the kernel to print the output to screen, and resuming back the program after the print task is done.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>So far, we have learned the existence of \textit{user mode}  and \textit{kernel mode} execution. Programs which code resides at addresses with MSB of 0 are user programs. Programs which code resides at addresses with MSB of 1 are kernel programs. Likewise for its stack (user stack vs kernel stack). Only kernel programs have access to all hardwares, and lives in the \textit{physical memory space}. User programs live in the \textit{virtual memory space}.</p>
<p>~\</p>
<p>~\</p>
<p>The kernel manages the execution of all programs, as well as all I/O units. It stores the states of all programs inside the process table in the kernel space. There are two ways to transfer control between user programs to kernel programs. Firstly, is by the IRQ signal (external interrupt, non-voluntary), and secondly is by invoking the Supervisor Call (voluntary interrupt as the program needs the kernel’s help, typically for I/O data).</p>
<p>~\</p>
<p>~\</p>
<p>During either case of interrupt, PC+4 is stored at register XP so that the user program may \textit{resume later}. The PC then \textit{traps} to the corresponding handler code, and the handler calls the appropriate programs that either invoke the IRQ call during interrupts or programs that can service the requested values during SVC. The handler knows which following service programs to invoke due to the arguments provided by the user program in R0 during SVC event.</p>
<p><sub>\</sub>\</p>
<p>When running in kernel mode, the kernel code <strong><strong>cannot be interrupted</strong></strong> to prevent security breach, data loss, or trapping into itself in a loop. Therefore, writing kernel code is a very difficult task. However, it brings convenience for the writing and execution of other user programs.</p>
