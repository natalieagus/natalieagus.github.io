**Natalie Agus (Fall 2020)**


This page contains all practice questions that constitutes the topics learned in <ins>Week 3</ins>: **Sequential Logic and Synchronization** and **FSM*. 

Each topic's questions are grouped into **three** categories: basic, intermediate, and challenging. You are recommended to do all basic problem set before advancing further.

# Sequential Logic and Synchronization

You can refer to the notes <a href="https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/sequential_logic" target="_blank">here</a> if you need to revise. 

### Warm-up Timing Computations (Basic)
  

Consider the following diagram of a simple sequential circuit:

The components labeled CL1 and CL2 are combinational; R1 and R2 are edge triggered

flip flops. Timing parameters for each component are as noted. Answer both questions below:
