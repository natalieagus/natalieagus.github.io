### Basics of Information Theory

  

#### Warm Up

  

Suppose that you are to guess the value of a 16-bit number: 0x$Z_1Z_2Z_3Z_4$ You are told that the value of $Z_1$ is B. Thus you have been given [N] bits of information. What is the value of [N]?

Obviously $Z_x$ represents 4 bits since these are in hexadecimal number system (indicated with the prefix of `0x`.) We are literally told that the first hex digit is $B = 1011$. Hence we are given ****4 bits of information****.  There are still other 12 bits that we do not know of its value.
